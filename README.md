# Simple-Mark

Edit Markdown with its formatting shown and its syntax still visible.

`# Heading` keeps its `#` while the heading appears larger. `**bold**` keeps its markers
while the text appears bold. Images and math render alongside their source, and tables can
be edited with the keyboard.

This repository contains TypeScript libraries for Markdown editing and rendering.

The former VS Code extension is preserved in the
[`vscode-v0.1.6` release](https://github.com/one-prime/simple-mark/releases/tag/vscode-v0.1.6).
Download its `.vsix` asset and run **Extensions: Install from VSIX…** in VS Code.

- **Embed an editor:** start with [@simple-mark/codemirror](packages/codemirror/README.md).
- **Try it locally:** run the browser demo using the instructions below.

## Features

- Markdown headings, emphasis, lists, quotes, and links styled without hiding their syntax.
- Syntax highlighting in fenced code blocks and TeX formulas.
- Inline math tooltips and block math previews, rendered with MathJax.
- Image previews below their Markdown source.
- Keyboard navigation and alignment for tables, including Korean, Chinese, and Japanese text.
- Shared parsing, themes, and rendering utilities for browser and canvas applications.

## Packages

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [@simple-mark/codemirror](packages/codemirror/README.md) | CodeMirror 6 editor and extensions |
| [@simple-mark/model](packages/model/README.md) | Markdown parsing, styled ranges, themes, and table utilities |
| [@simple-mark/math](packages/math/README.md) | TeX-to-SVG rendering with MathJax |
| [@simple-mark/highlight](packages/highlight/README.md) | Code highlighting with languages loaded on demand |
| [@simple-mark/canvas](packages/canvas/README.md) | Markdown layout and drawing on a canvas |

The packages use npm workspaces, so local development links them together.

## Use the editor in an application

```bash
npm install @simple-mark/codemirror
```

Given an HTML element such as `<div id="editor"></div>`:

```ts
import { createEditor } from '@simple-mark/codemirror';

const view = createEditor(document.getElementById('editor')!, {
  doc: '# Hello **world**\n',
  onChange: (text) => console.log(text),
});

// When the editor is no longer needed:
// view.destroy();
```

See the [editor options](packages/codemirror/README.md) for image and link handling.
When bundling the editor, configure the [MathJax font alias](packages/math/README.md)
so it uses the intended font.

## Develop locally

Use Node.js 24 or newer and npm. Run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/one-prime/simple-mark.git
cd simple-mark
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5180> to try the browser editor demo.

Run the project checks with:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the editor's design and architecture.

## Package the libraries

To build the reusable packages and create npm tarballs locally:

```bash
npm run release -- --pack
```

The tarballs are written to `dist/release/`. This command does not publish to npm.
The [release script](scripts/release.mjs) documents dry-run and publishing options.
